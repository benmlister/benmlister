  <h1>INTJ-A:</h1>
  <p class="lead">The Architect</p>
  <p>People with an INTJ-A personality type make up a small percentage of the population, they are often quiet and tend to reserve themselves in a larger group. As an INTJ, I feel that this is an accurate portrayal of my personality. I wouldn't necessarily say that I am a closet introvert, but I definitely recharge when I am by myself rather than in a group setting.</p>
  <p>INTJ's prefer working by themselves or in a small group, for me, this means that I will consciously have to try harder to work in a team setting. When forming a team, I should ensure that there is a mix of personality types to ensure that we get the best out of everyone.</p>

  <h1>Visual Learning</h1>
  <p>As a visual learner, I will tend to learn best when information is presented in a visual form either as written text, as a graphic or in an interactive way.</p>
  <p>In a team setting, I will benefit from face to face interactions and remember information better by drawing or outlining what has been discussed in text form. When forming a team, I should look for people with a mixture of learning styles, having someone else that is a visual learner would also be of great help because ideas can be bounced back and forth in a way that then can be explained to other team members.</p>

  <h1>The Big 5 Personality Test</h1>
  <p class="lead">This Big Five assessment measures your scores on five major dimensions of personality: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism</p>
  <img src="files/big-5-scores.jpg">
  <p>My results indicate that I have a higher than average tendency to think in abstract, complex ways. My higher than average scores of conscientiousness suggest that I have the ability to exercise self-discipline, am well organised and determined. As seen from my Myers Briggs personality results, I am seen to be an introvert, not recharging from social events, but rather having quiet time to myself. At 75% on the agreeableness scale, I take great joy in helping others. I don't lack empathy, am trusting and forgiving. Neuroticism describes a person’s tendency to experience negative emotions. I fortunately have a low score resulting in me not dwelling on misfortune, but getting on with life and moving on.</p>
  <p>In a group setting, my high scores in openness, conscientiousness and agreeableness should help me to work well in a team. My results suggest that I will be able to provide abstract, out-of-the-box ideas, whilst also wanting to work hard to not let other team members down. When looking for other team members, I should seek out classmates or colleagues who have a high openness score as it should be an indication of their honesty and trustworthiness.</p>

    <h3>About myself</h3>
    <p>I was born in Cairns, and after graduating from Cairns State High School in 2008, went straight into the workforce selling and repairing computers. From there I moved into a video production role which lead to me starting a Bachelor of Multimedia Studies at Central Queensland University soon I realised that Information Technology (IT) was my real passion. 
</p>
  </div>
  <div class="tabs-panel" id="panel2">
    <h3>Interest in IT</h3>
    <p>Everything revolves around Information Technology, from our mobile phones to smart watches, wireless music. I began to be interested in IT during high school, not realising that I would go down the IT career path until I was working in video production and studying Bachelor of Multimedia Studies at Central Queensland University. It was my time shooting and editing videos where I became fascinated with software design, file/data management, compression formats and websites.</p><p>
My fascination with websites lead me to working with a design and development team working on The Living Knowledge Place. I was completely in over my head. I didn’t know html, I had no experience with databases and I had no clue what php was. Eventually when the site was finished, we required additional geographic areas added to the site. My task was to reverse engineer the site, learn how it functioned, and add the new areas to the site.
I am now employed as a systems analyst and program support officer and have experience setting up and administrating web servers, deploying and managing web systems, website design and development.</p><p>
RMIT appeals to me for multiple reasons. For starters, RMIT is a global university recognised for leadership and innovation in technology, design and enterprise and scores in the top 250 QS World University Rankings. RMIT University also appeals to me because of the flexible learning structure and strong online presence, studying through Open Universities Australia allows me to break my degree down into four terms, allowing me to maintain a high study load while working full time.</p><p>
During my time at RMIT University, I expect to learn how to work effectively in part of a development team. I also expect to learn key skills relating to that different intricacies that is IT, from cyber security and system administration to big data, analytics and business intelligence.</p>

    <h3>Project: Smart hot water</h3>
    <p>With the cost of living increasing year over year, it is becoming more and more difficult to try and save money. Energy prices are ever increasing, water is becoming more and more valuable due to its short supply. Electric hot water systems are unfortunately not the most efficient way to heat water and there is currently no way to manage the use of hot water in households. This isn’t surprising when electric hot water systems haven’t changed in design for at over 20 years. This project aims to create a Smart Electric Hot Water System that automatically adjusts its efficiency around your household and your day-to-day activities and calendar events.
</p><p>
The goal of this project is to create a Smart Electric Hot Water System that automatically adjusts the volume and temperature that water is heated to based on household water-use patterns and external factors like intake water temperature. For example, the system would, over a course of time, pick up on how many times a day people would have showers, at what times and the duration. It could potentially automatically create profiles for different family members based on the information it collects over time. The software could also identify changes in flow when other household appliances are using hot water.
</p><p>
This product will have several hardware and software features. No longer will hot water systems be a dull grey cylinder placed in a cupboard hidden from the world. This Smart Hot Water System will feature an elegant rectangular design, crafted out of recycled anodised aluminium. It is will be available in multiple colour options and available in both a gloss and matte finish. Built-in is a generous OLED touchscreen that displays daily, weekly and monthly water and electricity usage information, as well as providing a friendly user interface for the initial setup. This unit also employs the use of WiFi and Bluetooth LE to allow it to connect to mobile phones for an easier setup option, and also allows it to connect to home automation software. The WiFi connection also allows the Smart Hot Water System to receive software updates in an easy way. The unit features 100% serviceability and all parts will be recyclable, this will ensure a long service life from the device. Software will be what drives this system enabling its energy and water saving features. The software will use machine learning to run data through a model and identify water-use patterns allowing it to automatically adjust the volume of water, resulting in less energy being required. Other software features include the following:
<ul>
<li>Compatibility with home automation software, including HomeKit</li>
<li>Parental control to allow parents to set shower limits for shower-hogging teenagers</li>
<li>Cloud connect program that links in with your calendar to allow the hot water system to identify periods when the house might be empty, like when you’re on a vacation</li>
<li>Flexible API to allow third parties to extend capabilities</li>
<li>Automatically tariff identification. If your Smart Hot Water System is connected to an energy saving tariff, it will automatically identify how long it has power and automatically adjust the volume and temperature of the water to ensure that there is enough hot water throughout the day</li></ul>
Also available will be an Android and iOS/ipadOS app that allows you to make manual tweaks to the settings, for example when additional guests might be staying with you. The app will also allow you to set and receive usage alerts if you have exceeded your daily usage limit.
</p><p>
Tools and technologies to create the prototype and achieve the desired outcome will include using a Raspberry PI computer with a multitude of sensors such as multiple temperature sensors, ambient temperature sensor, water level sensor, power sensor. A WLAN and Bluetooth LE chip will also be required. Software will be developed in JAVA, as it is well documented, supports machine learning and is easy to compile across multiple operating systems.
</p><p>
Other useful skills to ensure a successful project will include a software engineer with expertise in JAVA, a thermodynamics specialist to work on correct insulation to prevent heat loss and contribute ideas to allow an efficient heating element, a mechanical and electrical engineer would be useful to work on product and circuitboard design. Later in the project, an app developer with sufficient experience with SWIFT and JAVA programming languages would be essential in creating an app for both the iOS and Android operating systems. A graphic designer that specialises in App design and user experience would be critical to ensure that the App and built-in software are easy and intuitive to use.
</p><p>
If this project is successful, a Smart Electric Hot Water System will be the outcome. It will allow thousands of people to conserve energy and water whilst saving money when it comes to hot water. It will allow users to become more familiar with their water usage allowing them to monitor and improve how their household uses hot water. A side benefit will also be that fewer hot water systems will end up in landfill due to the hot water system having 100% user replaceable parts and being 100% recyclable.</p>

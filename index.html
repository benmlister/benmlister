    <h3>About myself</h3>
    <p>I was born in Cairns, and after graduating from Cairns State High School in 2008, went straight into the workforce selling and repairing computers. From there I moved into a video production role which lead to me starting a Bachelor of Multimedia Studies at Central Queensland University soon I realised that Information Technology (IT) was my real passion. 
</p>

  <div class="tabs-panel" id="panel2">
    <h3>Interest in IT</h3>
    <p>Everything revolves around Information Technology, from our mobile phones to smart watches, wireless music. I began to be interested in IT during high school, not realising that I would go down the IT career path until I was working in video production and studying Bachelor of Multimedia Studies at Central Queensland University. It was my time shooting and editing videos where I became fascinated with software design, file/data management, compression formats and websites.</p><p>
My fascination with websites lead me to working with a design and development team working on The Living Knowledge Place. I was completely in over my head. I didn’t know html, I had no experience with databases and I had no clue what php was. Eventually when the site was finished, we required additional geographic areas added to the site. My task was to reverse engineer the site, learn how it functioned, and add the new areas to the site.
I am now employed as a systems analyst and program support officer and have experience setting up and administrating web servers, deploying and managing web systems, website design and development.</p><p>
RMIT appeals to me for multiple reasons. For starters, RMIT is a global university recognised for leadership and innovation in technology, design and enterprise and scores in the top 250 QS World University Rankings. RMIT University also appeals to me because of the flexible learning structure and strong online presence, studying through Open Universities Australia allows me to break my degree down into four terms, allowing me to maintain a high study load while working full time.</p><p>
During my time at RMIT University, I expect to learn how to work effectively in part of a development team. I also expect to learn key skills relating to that different intricacies that is IT, from cyber security and system administration to big data, analytics and business intelligence.</p>

    <h3>Ideal Job</h3>
    <p>As an amateur triathlete and a lover of data and analytics, an ideal job for me would be a Staff Embedded Software Engineer in an organisation like FitBit, Polar, Garmin or Apple. A job like this will allow me to create and improve software that runs on sports watches and allow users to track important health metrics and track training goals in an easy and intuitive way. This particular role advertised by FitBit would allow me to work across through the entire development process from initial software design to user interface and experience. User experience is a vital aspect of why this job appeals to me.</p>

<p>The following skills, qualifications and experience are required:
<ul>
  <li>Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or comparable skill</li>
<li>5-8+ years professional experience working in RTOS (or embedded Linux) and bare metal environments</li>
<li>Proven strong coding skill</li>
<li>Proven strong understanding of software design - technology, methods and approaches</li>
<li>Experience with one or more relevant technologies such as Bluetooth LE, WLAN, sensors, or graphics</li>
<li>Experience with hardware debug and ultra low power / ultra small footprint software design is preferred</li>
<li>We have opportunities for candidates with a range of professional experience.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Currently, I have the following skills and experience:
<ul>
  <li>3 years working with linux servers, administering remotely through command line prompt</li>
<li>Strong web development skills, including design</li>
<li>Deploying and managing web systems at scale</li>

</ul></p>

To equip myself with the necessary skills, qualification and experience to meet the requirements for my ideal job, I plan to complete a Bachelor of Information Technology through RMIT University. I will contribute to open source sports analysis sites like runalyze. I also plan to continue developing my programming skills, create prototype watches and experiment with latest technologies and APIs surrounding health sensors and wireless technologies such as Bluetooth LE and WLAN.
